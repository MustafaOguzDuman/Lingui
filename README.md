We propose an app solution, in which users will be able to find personalized YouTube content, tailored to their vocabulary at that time. The videos will be prioritized according to the set of words they are currently learning. 

Firstly, there will be a test consisting of 5 videos, in which users will mark the words they do not know. After that, the algorithm will select videos that contain sentences that are challenging, but comprehensible to the user. 

New words will be taught to the user by a spaced repetition system, and this feature will ask cloze test questions to the user to see if they really learned the word.
